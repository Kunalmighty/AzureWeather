Weather App: WONDER WEATHER!

This is a Windows Universal App, best viewed on a mobile device.

The Azure API App and client have their separate solutions, as that is how I saw it fitting best.
So the project contains 2 apps – the weather API app itself (‘WeatherAPIDemo’),
and a client app to add or retrieve weather (‘WeatherClient’).

1) The UI is responsive in both landscape and portrait modes. 
This has been achieved mainly by keeping the interface clean and simple and then using scrollviewers.
2) The app supports returning and displaying the Average High and Low Pressure for Year, Month, Week and Day.
3) The app also supports returning and displaying the Average, High and Low Humidity for Year, Month, Week and Day.
